    "1. A more recent update, that contains inaccurate information on management responsibilities - but one that also contains unique information on paternity leave.\n",
    "1. A newer policy document that contains updated information about management responsibilities, correcting the mistakes of the previous modernising attempt - alongside some other HR policy information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good system will be able to:\n",

    "- synthesize contradicting information and only present to us the correct ones\n",

    "Regarding synthesizing information, there are contradictions between the documents pertaining to management responsibilities. We are going to use the \n",
